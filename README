---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Due to the lack of interesting options for film emulation in Darktable, some time ago I started to play around with my own presets, as a way to have some to use in my photos but also to better understand Darktable, specially the tone curves.

In my spare time, and while I processed my own photos, I created, tested and adapted my set of presets, based in in others people's presets (specially the Black and White film presets), a handful of articles and examples on the actual films and, most of all, the G'MIC film emulation options. Carefuly I adjusted

-- Install --
Go to Styles box in Lighttable mode, click Import and select all or only the ones you want to install. It should become available in the styles box or the styles quick access icon in Darkroom mode.

-- Uninstall -- 
Go to Styles box in Lighttable mode, select the style and click Delete. Must be done manually for all.

-- Usage -- 
Just apply the selected preset, And you're ready to go. 
It's highly recommended to have the White Balance properly set before applying it. These presets where created using Darktable's default base curves for each camera model except for Fuji, where I use my a slightly smother basecurve (very slightly) as I feel the the default one has a bit too much contrast. If you use a custom basecurve to add more contrast or have other modules in the pipeline adding contrast, then expect strange results. 


-- Changelog --
